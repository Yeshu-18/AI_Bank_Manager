#         <ol>
#             <li><b>Check Eligibility:</b> You should have secured admission to a recognized institution in India or abroad. A co-applicant (parent or guardian) may be required.</li>
#             <li><b>Choose the Loan Type:</b> We offer both secured (with collateral) and unsecured (without collateral) loans. Loan amounts and interest rates vary accordingly.</li>
#             <li><b>Submit Required Documents:</b> This includes identity proof, admission letter, fee structure, income proof of the co-applicant, and collateral documents (if applicable).</li>
#             <li><b>Loan Processing & Approval:</b> Once we verify the documents and eligibility, we will assess your loan application. If approved, a sanction letter will be issued.</li>
#             <li><b>Loan Disbursement:</b> Upon signing the loan agreement, the loan amount will be disbursed directly to the educational institution.</li>
#             <li><b>Repayment Terms:</b> Repayment typically begins after a moratorium period (course duration + 6-12 months). We provide flexible EMI options to make repayment easier.</li>
